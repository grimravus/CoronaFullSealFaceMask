# CoronaFullSealFaceMask
Pattern for a DIY full-seal face mask with metal strip.

Here is the pattern for the face mask.  Start with four rectangles 6 inches by 7 inches, stack them, and pin them together with the cut out pattern on top.  Cut out along the outer dark line -- the dotted lines are meant to show stitch locations.  Then follow the instructions on the pattern or watch my YouTube Video.

You can use Adobe Reader to print the PDF -- make sure you check the "Actual Size" box to PREVENT Adobe from shrinking the image to "fit the page".  When it's printed correctly, the diagram of the metal strip should be 6.25 inches long.

I used a piece of aluminum roof flashing for the metal strip -- 6.25 inches long by 0.5 inches wide.  Flashing can be cut with heavy scissors.  

If you don't have it, and don't want to buy 10 feet of flashing, you can laminate 8 layers of aluminum soda or beer can to get about the right stiffness/bendability.  Cut the top and bottom off of two cans, then slice lengthwise up the side of the remaining cyliners to make two rectangular sheets of thin aluminum.  Then cut 4 strips 0.5 inches wide from the long side of each rectangle to get 8 strips.  Stack them like a long thin deck of cards.  Lay a 6-inch peice of 2 inch packing tape on the table with the sticky side up, and then lay your stack on this, about 0.5 inches from the edge of the tape.  Fold that half-inch edge over to the top of the stack as tightly as you can, then roll the stack tightly over and over to wind the tape around the stack.  Trim the ends round to leave a 6.25 inch long laminated strip 0.5 inches wide.  Make the sleeve in the mask a little wider to make it easier to slip this laminated peice into the mask.  There's plenty of material in the pattern for this.

Once the mask is finished, put it on the intended wearer, and bend the metal over the bridge of the nose, and then flare it outward to make it seal over the nose and against the cheek bones.

Good Luck!
